# AutomatedDL

Machine Learning is all about predicting the accurate as well as precise results for a problem and for achieving fractions of units of accuracy we end up investing a lot of time in training the model.<br/>
But what if this can be automated!!!All the developer needs to do is create model and forget about making hit and trials to achieve few extra numbers!<br/>
And to achieve this feat we have the DevOps.We can automate model training using Jenkins-Docker-Github integration and few python and bash scripts.<br/>
This project demonstrates that using a banking system prediction model for customer retention.
